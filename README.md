Laser Cut Homework

Assignment: Design a simple form to cut/engrave on the laser using your own materials.
Settings:(power, speed, frequency)
Cut: (100, 1, 6000)
Engrave: (80,10, 6000)

For this project I wanted to try and create a business card for Karen. I wanted to experiment with a non-standard acrylic (red with a thin top white layer), see how it'd feel to have an acrylic business card, work with type and try cutting and engraving. I learned that if cuts are made too close together it can sort of melt the center cut out. I also realized that it was easier to remove the protective plastic before cutting, especially if cuts will leave very small sections ontouched. I also noticed that the red coloring from the acrylic smeared on some of the white after being cut and immediatedly being touched, didn't seem to stain anything though.
